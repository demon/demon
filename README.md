Hello! I'm Chad. I've been on the internet for a long time. I work for an awesome place called [Rad AI](https://github.com/radaisystems) doing DevOps/SRE work. In past lifetimes, I was at [@wikimedia](https://github.com/wikimedia) doing all kinds of open source stuff. Python is my jam, I write way too much Yaml for my own good, and I've been practicing DevOps longer than it's been a job title. 

When I'm not doing code stuff, I'm usually playing with my dog Tobi üêï
