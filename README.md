Free-form profiles? What Myspace-esque devilry is this?!

Hello! I'm Chad. I've been on the internet for a long time. I spent many years working at @wikimedia doing all kinds of cool open source stuff.
Nowadays I'm kickin' it with @lumahealthhq, helping connect people to their healthcare.
Python is my jam, I write way too much Yaml for my own good, and I've been practicing DevOps longer than it's been a job title.

PS: When I'm not doing code stuff, I'm usually playing with my dog Tobi üêï
